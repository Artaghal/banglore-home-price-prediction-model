# Price prediction ML-model using Banglore-House-Price dataset  

This project is a complete but simple view of data-science concepts, machine learning model building with a simple web-interface. I encourage data-science beginners to go through this project to understand how different components are to consider and developed.

#### **Step-1**:

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.

Here is link to my notebook: [How to build real-estate price prediction model] (https://www.kaggle.com/wasimkhan/complete-ml-model-with-web-interface-for-testing)
you can comment over there for explanation with any-step. Don't miss encouraging me through upvote.

#### **Step-2**:

Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the our ML-model to serve http requests. The server folder contain all the code. let me know, if you face any difficulty.

#### **Step-3**:

Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

#### **Technology and tools wise this project covers**:

    Python
    Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
    Matplotlib for data visualization
    Sklearn for model building
    Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
    Python flask for http server
    HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
